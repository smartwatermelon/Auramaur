"""Regime-switched risk parameters: grow aggressively at small equity,
preserve at large equity.

At $450 of equity the geometric advantage of conservative Kelly (0.30) is
irrelevant — the book is capital-starved and the dominant failure mode is
failing to compound, not volatility. As equity grows toward a working-book
size, we smoothly transition into the preservation-tuned config values.

The three dimensions we switch on:
  * kelly_fraction   — size multiplier on edge
  * max_stake        — absolute cap per market (flat $ in preservation,
                       percent-of-equity in growth so stakes scale with book)
  * min_edge_pct     — minimum edge required before a trade is considered

Regime boundaries:
  equity < GROWTH_MAX           -> pure growth
  GROWTH_MAX <= equity < PRES_MIN -> linear transition
  equity >= PRES_MIN            -> pure preservation (config values)
